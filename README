Source for the Android AtHome app

This is the git repository from the Android Studio
development for the app.  The app is created with
Android Studio 3.2.1.

Personally, I've had `issues` when trying to import
a current project into a working Android Studio
development environment but hopefully that's just
me.  This is just a verbose way of saying I probably
won't be of much help if you have problems setting up
a development environment, you're basically on your
own for that.

First build:
If you clone this tree and try and build under Android
Studio it will fail.  The problem is that I am too lazy
to manually maintain version numbers (a critical part
of the release mechanism for the Google Play store).
I solve this problem by using a git post commit hook
that generates a new version number after every commit.
Since I don't want to have a modified version number
file that's attached to every commit there is a template
file, app/version.tmpl, that the post commit hook uses
to create the actual version file.  All you have to do
is copy this file to app/version.h and Android Studio
will be happy.
