Source for the Android AtHome app

This is the git repository from the Android Studio
development for the app.  The app is created with
Android Studio 3.2.1.

Personally, I've had `issues` when trying to import
a current project into a working Android Studio
development environment but hopefully that's just
me.  This is just a verbose way of saying I probably
won't be of much help if you have problems setting up
a development environment, you're basically on your
own for that.
