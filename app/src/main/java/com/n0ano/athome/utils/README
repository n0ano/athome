Utility scripts for the server

These scripts are needed to setup a Linux machine as in image server
for the screen saver.  The basic operation is that the user emails a
photo to `frame@server.com'.  The subject of the email is the title
for the photo and the actual photo is attached to the email.  A missing
subject just means there's no title for this photo.  The assumption is
that the user wants to forward a copy of the message onto another email
address (e.g. the Brookstone Photo Frame email address) and the user
also wants to send the picture to the local image server.

The user `frame@server.com' is the recipient of this message.  The
`.procmailrc' file for `frame' will call the `~frame/bin/mailit'
script to handle the email forwarding.

The `mailit' script will forward the message onto the Brookstone Photo
Frame email address (just comment out the `sendmail' line if you don't
have a Brookstone Photo Frame).  The script will then use `ssh' to
execute the command `~frame/bin/save_photo' on the actual image server.

The `mailit' script will then extract the image files from the email
message, store them in the right place on the image server, and then
update the image servers meta-data to indicate that a new image file
is available.
