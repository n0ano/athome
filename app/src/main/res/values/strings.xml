ecoBee provides a rather baroque process
for validating that an application is
allowed to access the data from your
intelligent thermostat.
As it turns out,
the easiest way to do this is to utilize
the ecoBee web portal.
This popup will try to make that
process as easy as possible for you.
<p>
Note that the portal promotes a slight misconception.
It talks about creating a new app and
authorizing that app.
Calling this an
<b>app</b>
is actually a
misnomer.
Rather than creating a new app
what we are really doing is authorizing
<i>this</i>
app to access
<i>your</i>
data.
<p>
Anyway,
once you press the <b>START</b>
button on this page
the authorizion process will
proceed as follows:
<p>-
Pressing the <b>Start</b>
button will spawn a browser that
goes to the ecoBee web portal.
<p>-
Follow the instructions on
that page to create
a new <i>app</i>.
<p>-
The new app will create a new
<b>API Key</b>.
<p>-
Continue following the instructions
on the page to obtain a new
<b>Pin</b> and <b>Authorization Code</b>.
(Don\'t forget to use the ecoBee
web portal to use the Pin to
validate the Authorization Code.)
<p>-
Switch back and forth between the
browser and the AtHome app so that
you can cut and paste the
<b>Api Key</b> from the browser into
the AtHome <b>Api Key</b> field and
also cut and paste the
<b>Authorization Code</b> from the browser
into the AtHome <b>Auth Token</b> field.
<p>-
All done.
Once you click
<b>OK</b>
on the <b>ecoBee</b>
popup the AtHome app will
finish the authorization process
and it should now be able to access
your thermostat data.
