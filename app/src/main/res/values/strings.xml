ecoBee provides a rather baroque process
for validating that an application is
allowed to access the data from your
intelligent thermostat.
As it turns out,
the easiest way to do this is to utilize
the ecoBee web portal.
This popup will try to make that
process as easy as possible for you.
<p>
Note that the portal promotes a slight misconception.
It talks about creating a new app and
authorizing that app.
Calling this an
<b>app</b>
is actually a
misnomer.
Rather than creating a new app
what we are really doing is authorizing
<i>this</i>
app to access
<i>your</i>
data.
<p>
Anyway,
once you press the <b>Start</b>
button on this page
the authorizion process can
proceed as follows:
<p>-
Pressing the <b>Start</b>
button will spawn a browser that
goes to the ecoBee web portal.
<p>-
Login to the portal with your
ecobee account info
(create a new account
if you don&quot;t have one).
<p>-
Follow the instructions on
the <b>Developer</b> section
to create a new <i>app</i>.
<p>-
The new app page will create a new
<b>API Key</b>.
<p>-
Copy that API key to the Android
clip board so you can paste it
into the AtHome app.
<p>-
Swith back to the AtHome app and
paste the API key into the <b>ecoBee</b>
popup
(you could manually type the key in
but it&quot;s long, random, and mistake
prone - cut/paste is a lot
easier).
<p>-
Press the <b>CREATE PIN</b> button.
This will display a new popup window
that shows a 4 character PIN.
Remember these 4 characters for the
next step.
<p>-
Switch back to the browser and
go to the <b>My Apps</b> section.
<p>-
Select the application you created
and press the <b>Add Application</b> button.
<p>-
In the new window enter the 4 digit
PIN that you got earlier and select
the <b>Validate</b> button.
<p>-
The window will change and you can
finally select the <b>Add Application</b>
button that replaced the <b>Validate</b>
button.
(Having a new button appear in the
same place as an old button is a
terrible UI choice,
especially when
that new button re-uses a prior
label but hey,
talk to ecoBee about that).
<p>-
Switch back to the AtHome app and
now press the <b>VALIDATED PIN</b> button.
<p>-
All done.
<p>
The AtHome app will now
finish the authorization process
and it should be able to access
your thermostat data.
