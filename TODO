1 - Null values for wind speed and rain when Weather underground
	not configured.

2 - Configurable refresh reates for eGauge and weather

3 - User manual

4 - Internationalization.  Lots of work required here.

5 - Nest support.  Hard to do since Nest has closed their
	developer network and I have no interest in trying
	to reverse engineer their API.
